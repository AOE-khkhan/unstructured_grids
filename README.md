# Unstructured Grids Add-on for Blender

## Introduction

Unstructured Grids (UG) is an add-on for [Blender
2.8](https://www.blender.org/2-8) for importing, editing and exporting
of 3D volume meshes composed of arbitrary polyhedron cells
(a.k.a [unstructured grids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_grid)).
The aim is to create a tool that can be used for minor editing of
unstructured grids (like moving vertices, and assigning boundary faces
to named patches) and possibly some special meshing cases.
Since volume meshes are not natively supported in Blender, it is
currently unknown how usable Blender can become for unstructured
grids.

This add-on is currently at proof-of-concept stage and work in progress.
